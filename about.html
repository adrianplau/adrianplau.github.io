            <p style="text-align:left;">The ideas and practices surrounding health and medicine in premodern South Asia attract broad scholarly and popular interest. Yet despite the proliferation of manuscript materials in emerging vernaculars, the early modern period remains an overlooked site of exploration. This project draws on the Wellcome Collection's rich archive of medicinal treatises, notebooks and miscellania in the vernaculars of early modern North India to present a range of previously unstudied materials to both the scholarly community and the general public. The emphasis on the popular vernacular allows us to go beyond the normative sources to see which diseases worried the merchants, which diagnostic practices were deemed to be effective across regions, and which recipes were thought worthy of copying across the centuries.</p>
