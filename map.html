            <p class="text">Of the nearly 200 early Hindi medical manuscripts in the <a href="https://wellcomecollection.org/">Wellcome Collection</a>, there are 
                19 that can be connected to a definite time and place. </p> 
            <p class="text"> The map below, developed using <a href="https://timemapper.okfnlabs.org/">TimeMapper</a>,
                displays these locations along with a timeline. The dates on the timeline refer to when the manuscript was copied, not when the work originally was composed.</p>
            <p class="text">The map indicates the circulation of vernacular medical treatises across different regions of early modern North India. Works were composed, copied, and circulated across large swathes of today's Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan. 
                The map also shows a pattern of circulation partly overlapping with the crossroads of these regions, where the predecessors of today's Hindi, such as Brajbhasha, arose in the same period.</p>
